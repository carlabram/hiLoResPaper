% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

	It is axiomatic that high resolution spectra yield better constraints on galaxy star formation
	histories (SFHs) than low resolution spectra or broadband photometry. We test this statement 
	by comparing predictions for high-resolution spectra generated from galaxy SFHs constrained
	by only $ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry and rest-optical	$R\sim100$ prism spectra to actual 
	$R\sim{\bfr 1000}$ spectroscopy obtained post-facto. In a sample of \ntot\ galaxies, we find 
	median differences between predicted and inferred Lick indices of <1\% for both starforming
	and passive galaxies in all indices except the Blamer lines---whose divergences are entirely 
	explained by unmodeled emission features---and the CN$_{1}$ and G4300 features in passive 
	galaxies, which diverge by 2\% and 1.5\%, \resp. As such, unless one can identify a scientific
	motivation to measure these features to similar or better precision when inferring galaxy SFHs,
	we find no utility in using high resolution spectroscopy to constrain SFH models, at least when
	the latter are sufficiently flexible to span a wide diversity of intrinsic growth trajectories. These
	findings cast serious doubt on the extent to which new projects to obtain such data at ever higher 
	redshifts will address core outstanding questions in galaxy evolution in novel ways.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is understanding stellar mass growth; i.e., galaxy
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are the key data in this work because 
they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar populations of known ages. The resulting 
coefficients yield the amount of stellar mass a galaxy is inferred to have formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each population's age.

Stellar populations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. As such, the above decompositions are 
usually degenerate. Such degeneracies are compounded by age-independent effects like metallicity and 
dust reddening. 

To alleviate those degeneracies, high resolution spectra ($R\sim1000$s) are often used in addition to 
galaxy broadband colors in the model fitting. The hope is that the details of absorption lines will potentially 
increase the contrast between stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicity, and so yield more accurate 
age/mass coefficients. The utility of these data is usually taken as axiomatic, but it is also readily testable. 

This paper presents an experiment that shows there is very little information in high resolution spectra
that enhance constraints on galaxy SFHs compared to inferences based on a combination of photometry and 
very low resolution ($R\lesssim100$s) prism spectra.\footnote{A future paper will extend this statement 
to photometry based inferences alone.} We perform this experiment by using precomputed SFH inferences
based on low resolution SEDs for a set of \ntot\ systems at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$ to produce predictions 
of each galaxy's high-resolution spectrum, and comparing these predictions to actual high resolution 
observations taken post-facto. With the exception of the Balmer lines---whose divergence from predictions 
is readily ascribable to emission line infilling---we find differences to be of order {\bfr whatever they are}, 
suggesting {\bfr whatever we say they do}.

Below, Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data on which our experiment is based, Section \ref{sec:results} 
shows the comparisons between our high resolution spectral predictions and the high resolution data, and
Section \ref{sec:discussion} describes the implications of these results. We use AB magnitudes and assume 
a \citet{Chabrier03} stellar initial mass function (IMF) with $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) =
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$ throughout.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Master sample}
\label{sec:master}

This experiment is based on the {\it Carnegie Spitzer IMACS Survey} \citep[CSI;][]{Kelson14a}. CSI provides
Magellan-IMACS Low- and Uniform-Dispersion Prism spectroscopy for objects with {\it Spitzer} 
$[3.5]\leq21$ in {\bfr XXX sq.~deg.} from {\bfr THESE FIELDS}. Combined with supplemental 
$ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry from the NEWFIRM archive (\CITE) and Canada-France-Hawai`i Telescope 
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; \CITE), these data were used to derive flexible SFHs for each galaxy as part of 
the redshift estimation process. The sample is complete to $\log\Mstel\sim10.3$ at $z\sim0.7$.
The spectral resolution of the prisms varies from $R\sim{\bfr XXX}$ to $R\sim{\bfr YYY}$ at
{\bfr wavelengths}, about {\bfr THIS MUCH WORSE} than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York00}.

\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} examine the CSI SFHs in detail. \citet{Dressler18} provides a thorough treatment 
of SFH inference quality in its Appendix as assessed via simulations and comparisons of objects with repeat 
observations. We defer the reader to those texts for that information, but briefly review the SFH inference 
process here. {\it None of these details are important in the context of the experiment we detail below}, which 
should be repeated using other approaches.

The CSI spectrophotometry was modeled by assuming 5 blocks SFHs spanned
