% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

	We compare actual $R\sim{\bfr 800}$ spectroscopy to model predictions based on galaxy 
	star formation histories (SFHs) inferred from much lower resolution data: $ugrizJK_{s}$ 
	photometry and $R\sim25$ rest-optical prism spectra. From \ntot\ systems, we find a median 
	difference of $\leq$1\% between all predicted and measured absorption features in the Lick index 
	bandpasses except the Blamer lines---explainable by unmodeled emission---and Ca4227 and 
	Fe5270 in {\it UVJ}-classified passive galaxies, which are 1.7\%--2.5\% weaker than expected. 
	{\bfr $\chi^{2}$ stuff.} As such, absent a Ca-- or Fe--age prior accurate to the 2\% level---whose 
	empirical apprehension is itself a motivation for SED fitting---we find no utility in adding 
	high resolution spectroscopy as an SFH modeling constraint, at least when using models that capture 
	the intrinsic diversity of real growth trajectories. Our results cast doubt on the extent to which 
	spectra from the {\it James Webb Space Telescope} will enhance our understanding of galaxy 
	growth and suggest that progress requires new tactics as much as new data.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is to understand stellar mass growth; i.e., galaxy
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are the key data in this work because 
they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar subpopulations of known ages. The resulting 
coefficients yield the amount of stellar mass a galaxy is inferred to have formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each subpopulation's age.
	
Different stellar subpopulations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. As such, galaxy decompositions 
are degenerate. Of course, those degeneracies are compounded by age-independent effects like metallicity 
and dust. 

High resolution spectra ($R\sim500$--5000) are often used to alleviate those degeneracies in SFH model 
fitting. The hope is that the absorption features that emerge in those data will increase the contrast 
between constituent stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicities, and yield more accurate 
age/mass coefficients. The utility of these data is usually taken as axiomatic, but it is also testable. 

Here we present experiment that shows there is in fact little information in high resolution spectra
that enhance constraints on galaxy SFHs compared to inferences based on a combination of broadband 
photometry and low resolution ($R\sim25$) prism spectra.\footnote{A future paper will extend this statement 
to pure photometry-based inferences.} We use precomputed SFH inferences based on such low resolution 
SEDs for a set of \ntot\ systems at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$ to produce predictions 
of each galaxy's high-resolution spectrum. We then compare those predictions to actual high resolution 
($R\sim800$) observations taken post-facto. With the exception of the Balmer lines---whose divergence 
from predictions is readily ascribable to emission line infilling---we find differences to be of order 
{\bfr whatever they are}, suggesting {\bfr whatever we say they do}.

Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data on which our experiment is based, Section \ref{sec:results} 
shows the comparisons between our spectral predictions and the high resolution data, and Section
\ref{sec:discussion} describes the implications of these results. We use AB magnitudes and assume 
a \citet{Chabrier03} stellar initial mass function (IMF) with $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) =
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$ throughout.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Master sample}
\label{sec:master}

This experiment is based on the {\it Carnegie Spitzer IMACS Survey} \citep[CSI;][]{Kelson14a}. CSI provides
Magellan-IMACS Low- and Uniform-Dispersion Prism spectroscopy (\CITE) for objects with {\it Spitzer} 
$[3.5]\leq21$ in {\bfr XXX sq.~deg.} from {\bfr THESE FIELDS}. Combined with supplemental 
$ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry from the NEWFIRM archive (\CITE) and Canada-France-Hawai`i Telescope 
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; \CITE), these data were used to derive flexible SFHs for each galaxy as part of 
the redshift estimation process. The sample is complete to $\logM\sim10.3$ at $z\sim0.7$.
The spectral resolution of the prisms varies from $R\sim{\bfr XXX}$ to $R\sim{\bfr YYY}$ at
{\bfr wavelengths}, about {\bfr THIS MUCH WORSE} than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York00}.

\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} examine the CSI SFHs in detail. \citet{Dressler18} provides a thorough treatment 
of CSI SFH quality in its Appendix. We defer the reader to those texts for that information, but briefly review 
the SFH inference process here. {\it None of these details are important in the context of the experiment we 
detail below}, which should be repeated using other approaches.

The CSI spectrophotometry was using 5 precomputed SEDs based on SFHs with constant star formation 
rates (SFRs) spanning:
\bitem
	\item 0.0 to 0.2 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.2 to 0.5 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.5 to 1.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 1.0 to 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$ to $z=5$;
\eitem
where $\tobs$ corresponds to the object's redshift and $z=5$ is taken as the onset of star formation. If 
the data prefer, the oldest bin can also take the form of a 1 Gyr top hat starting at $z=5$.
The median redshift of the samples studied in \citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} is $z\sim0.7$, or $\tobs\sim7$ Gyr.

Each of the above SEDs was allowed to take an independent $A_{V}$ (assuming a \citealt{Calzetti00} 
extinction law) but not metallicity. The latter was inferred using a prior peaked at $Z=Z_{\odot}$. As such,
the predicted spectra do not capture the likely enrichment history of any object 
\citep[cf.][]{Pacifici12, Morishita19}---a fact to bear in mind as we proceed.

All spectral templates were generated using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis 
\citep[FSPS;][]{ConroyGunnWhite09} assuming default abundance patterns. When inferring the SFHs, 
these models---5 mass amplitudes + 5 $A_{V}$s + 1 metallicity + 1 redshift + 1 spectrophotometry fluxing 
factor = 12 free parameters---were typically constrained by 7 + {\bfr $\sim$100} photometric + spectral 
datapoints. The spectral models studied below are were regenerated using the best-fit SFH parameters
at $R\sim800$ in the rest optical. Uncertainties are tabulated for the SFH bins but {\it not} propagated
to the high resolution model spectra. As they therefore rely purely on data uncertainties, all comparisons 
below should be regarded as conservative.
