\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is to understand stellar mass growth; i.e., 
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are the key empirical anchor 
in this work because they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar populations of 
known ages. The resulting coefficients encode the stellar mass a galaxy formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each population's age.
	
Different stellar populations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. Thus, galaxy SED decompositions 
and the SFHs inferred therefrom are degenerate. The degeneracies are compounded by 
formally age-independent effects like metallicity and dust. 

In theory, using higher resolution spectra should ameliorate this issue: the absorption lines visible 
in such data increase the contrast between stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicities, and so yield 
better age/mass coefficients. In practice, this is not the case.

%\citet{Pacifici12} showed that $R\sim1000$ rest optical spectra do not markedly improve
%SFH estimates compared to $R\sim100$ spectra. Here, we show that, once combined with UV--IR
%photometry, all of the information in higher resolution spectra can be captured.

We perform a simple experiment to assess the added utility of $R\sim800$ optical spectra in 
reconstructing SFHs as compared to $R\sim25$ optical prism data and broadband UV--IR photometry. 
We:
\benum
	\item infer SFHs from low resolution data;
	\item create high resolution model spectra from those inferences;
	\item compare the predictions to high resolution data obtained post facto for the same
		objects. 
\eenum

In a sample of \ntot\ galaxies at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$, we predict all but one Lick absorption 
feature \citep{Worthey94} to better than 1\% in the median---including 
{\bfr those outside the original prsim bandpass}. The exception---Ca4227 in passive 
galaxies only---is known to behave anomalously, and is only $\sim$2.5\% weaker than expected. 

We conclude that the additional pixels in high resolution spectra do not add meaningful 
flux- or colour-related SED constraints compared to much more coarsely but broadly sampled data.
As such, we suggest future surveys aimed at supporting SFH reconstruction opt for 
wavelength coverage over spectral resolution in their designs.

Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data for our experiment. Section \ref{sec:results} compares 
the spectral predictions to the high resolution data; \ref{sec:upshot} contains our key results. 
Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses implications. We use AB magnitudes and assume 
a \citet{Chabrier03} stellar initial mass function (IMF) with $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) =
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$ throughout.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Master sample}
\label{sec:master}

We use data from the {\it Carnegie Spitzer IMACS Survey} \citep[CSI;][]{Kelson14a}. CSI provides
Magellan-IMACS Low- and Uniform-Dispersion Prism spectroscopy (\CITE) for objects with {\it Spitzer} 
$[3.5]\leq21$ in {\bfr XXX sq.~deg.} from {\bfr THESE FIELDS}. Combined with supplemental 
$ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry from the NEWFIRM archive (\CITE) and Canada-France-Hawai`i Telescope 
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; \CITE), these data were used to derive flexible SFHs for each galaxy
during redshift estimation. The sample is unbiased to $\logM\sim10.3$ at $z\sim0.7$.
The spectral resolution of the prisms varies from $R\sim{\bfr XXX}$ to $R\sim{\bfr YYY}$ at
{\bfr wavelengths}, about {\bfr 80$\times$} coarser than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York00}.

We derive SFHs from these data in two ways. Our results are quantitatively similar
using either approach.

%{\it None of these details are important in the context of the experiment we 
%detail below}, which should be repeated using other approaches.

\subsubsection{Technique 1 for inferring SFHs from low resolution SEDs}
\label{sec:blocks}

The CSI spectrophotometry was first modeled using 5 precomputed SEDs based on SFHs with 
constant star formation rates from:
\bitem
	\item 0.0 to 0.2 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.2 to 0.5 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.5 to 1.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 1.0 to 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$ to $z=5$;
\eitem
where $\tobs$ corresponds to the object's redshift and $z=5$ is taken as the onset of star formation. If 
the data prefer, the oldest bin could also take the form of a 1 Gyr top hat starting at $z=5$. 
\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} examine these SFHs in detail with the latter containing a thorough 
treatment of their quality in its Appendix.

In the fits, the above SED bases shared a common metallicity but could take independent extinctions 
(\citealt{Calzetti00} law). Those were estimated by replicating the stellar template four times
at four different {\bfr $A_{V}\in{0,0.5,1.0,2.0}$} values and finding their best-fit non-negative
superposition. This process enabled each stellar population to be screened by potential complex dust
geometries. Global metallicities were inferred from templates spanning 
$-0.6\leq\logZ\leq0.3$ in 0.1 dex steps with a fitting prior peaked at $Z=Z_{\odot}$. 
As such, the predicted spectra do not capture enrichment 
histories \citep[cf.][]{Pacifici12, Morishita19}. The predictive accuracy of these models stands despite 
this shortcoming (Section \ref{sec:results}).

The spectral templates were generated using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis 
\citep[FSPS;][]{ConroyGunnWhite09} assuming default abundance patterns. When inferring the SFHs, 
these models---5 mass amplitudes $\times$ 4 $A_{V}$s + 1 metallicity + 1 redshift + 4 emission line/blend 
amplitudes = 26 free parameters---were typically constrained by 
7 + {\bfr $\sim$150} photometric + spectral datapoints. Redshifts were gridded in $\Delta z = 0.005$ 
increments and solved for jointly with the other parameters.

Hereafter, we refer to this approach as ``Technique 1.''

\subsubsection{Technique 2 for inferring SFHs from low resolution SEDs}
\label{sec:h1}

Subsequent to \citet{Dressler18}, all CSI spectrophotometry was refit using a new 
SFH inference scheme based on a library of 500 $H=1$ stochastic tracks
(\citealt{Kelson14,Kelson16,Kelson20}, Abramson in preparation). The tracks comprise 200 
independent increments and are agnostic to the age of the universe: the same track can be stretched 
to span an arbitrary $t\in[t_{0},\,\tobs]$ interval, with the absolute size of each increment in years 
changing with a galaxy's redshift. The fits assumed a $t_{0}$ of $z=10$ and the star formation 
increment at the sample's mean redshift was 33.5 Myr. Model spectrophotometry was
generated at $\Delta z = 0.01$ intervals for redshift estimation.

These models assume monolithic values for both metallicity and extinction. Templates were generated
at $-1.5\leq\logZ\leq0.3$ in 0.3 dex steps {\bfr with a fitting prior peaked at $Z=Z_{\odot}$}. Following 
\citealt{Pacifici12}, the fitter finds for each $H=1$ track in the library the probability that it generated
an observed SED given a redshift, metallicity, $A_{V}$, spectral fluxing function 
({\bfr $\propto \lambda^{k}$}), and set of four emission line/blend amplitudes. All SED templates 
were generated using FSPS with default abundances.

Hereafter, we refer to this approach as ``Technique 2.''

\subsection{High resolution spectroscopy}
\label{sec:hiRes}

\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} identified a class of galaxies inferred to have formed at least half of 
their stars within 1--2 Gyr of the epoch of observation---``late bloomers.'' We obtained high 
resolution---$R\sim800$---rest-optical spectra with Magellan-IMACS to crosscheck and further 
interpret the nature of such objects. We use these data here as the benchmarks against which to
compare the predictions from the fits discussed in the previous section.
%were obtained for a subset of both late blooming and non late blooming galaxies
%at $z\sim0.7$, or $\tobs\sim7$ Gyr.

{\bfr We got the data in DATES. Here's how many objects, and a brief description of the data's
$S/N$/quality/etc.}

Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows the distributions in {\bfr stellar mass, {\it UVJ} colour-colour space, 
and inferred half-mass time} of the sample objects.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Here we compare the model high resolution spectra generated from the SFHs inferred using 
Techniques 1 and 2 (Sections \ref{sec:blocks}, \ref{sec:h1}) to actual high resolution spectra taken for
the same objects. We find that the median predicted line strength is, in all but one case, within 1\% 
of the measured value. 

We study the model spectrum corresponding to
the maximum-likelihood SFH fit. Uncertainties are tabulated for the SFHs and attendant 
parameters, but not propagated to the high resolution spectral models. As such,
the comparisons below treat the predictions as more credible than they are. Combined with the fact 
that the model metallicities are age-independent, our experiment is biased towards 
revealing significant differences between the data and the predictions. Any offsets we find---in units
of flux or standard deviations---are thus closer to upper limits. %: the latter are less flexible than they could be and given greater credence than they should be.

{\bfb LEA -- some note here about whether we're going to focus on the full spectrum or just the ``line
strengths.'' The latter is justified because it's the real value-add of the high-res data, and also because
I assume the same photometry was used to flux both the prism data and the high-res spectra. We
just have to explain it.}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Figure \ref{fig:scheme} outlines the experiment. The {\bfr top} panels show the
CSI spectrophotometry for a galaxy at redshift {\bfr ZZZ}, along with its inferred SFH using Technique 
1 (left) and 2 (right). The CSI data have broad wavelength 
coverage and dense but coarse sampling over the rest optical. As such, they reflect a relatively
complete accounting of a galaxy's stellar photospheric continuum emission. With the exception of the
strongest/broadest absorption features---e.g., H$\beta$; the Mg $\lambda$5170 triplet---these data are 
insensitive to absorption lines and any historical information they might convey.

Figure \ref{fig:scheme}, {\bfr bottom}, shows the complete high resolution IMACS spectrum of 
this object with the matched-resolution spectral predictions from the SFHs in the top panels overlaid. 
Results from Techniques 1 and 2 are in {\bfr color 1} and {\bfr color 2}, \resp. 

The data in the two top panels are identical; only the models change from left to right. Likewise,
both model predictions are compared to the same $R\sim800$ IMACS data. We therefore perform two 
experiments in parallel, identical except for the method from which the high resolution prediction is 
generated. {\bfr We comment on the differences between the results from each
technique in Sections XYZ, but they are ancillary to our main point.}

Figure \ref{fig:metric} illustrates how we compare our spectral predictions to the high resolution data.
Here, we re-present Figure \ref{fig:scheme}, bottom, zoomed-in to the region surrounding {\bfr FEATURE}.
{\bfb LEA -- If we need to divide the data by the model, we'll make this 2 panels.} The central 
bandpass of the corresponding Lick index is shown in {\bfr however} (\CITE). We define 
the mismatch between prediction and high resolution data as:
\begin{equation}
	\bfr \Delta = {\rm whatever~Dan~says}.
\end{equation}
That is, a quoted difference of 5\% in a given spectral feature corresponds to {\bfr whatever per-angstrom
offset integrated over however many angstroms, or whatever Dan did.}

We then compute {\bfr$\Delta$} for each Lick bandpass in each galaxy.

{\bfb LEA -- Here is where we talk about limiting ourselves to a comparison in the lines or mention
that we calculate global $\chi^{2}$ values and point to where we'll discuss those.}

\subsection{Sample-wide outcomes}
\label{sec:upshot}

Figure \ref{fig:resids} and Table \ref{tbl:stats} summarize the quality of our model predictions 
across the entire \ntot\ object sample; i.e., the overall outcome of our experiment. In the figure, 
results from Techniques 1 and 2 are shown in the top and bottom panels, \resp. At the central 
wavelength of each feature, we show the median, 16th, and 84th percentile offsets in a given sample. 
Results based on the full sample are shown in black, with red and blue boxes denoting 
{\bfr SFR- or age-defined} subsamples, \resp. The width of each box corresponds to the width of 
that feature's Lick bandpass. Regimes outside the original prism wavelength range are highlighted 
{\bfr in some color}. The dashed and dotted horizontal lines \resp\ benchmark mismatches at the 
$\pm$1\% and $\pm$2\% level.

Clearly, {\it almost all rest-optical galaxy absorption features 
visible at $R\sim800$ are predictable to better than 1\% by models tuned to data with $\sim$30$\times$
lower resolution} but broader wavelength coverage. That is, to a very high degree of accuracy, one can 
infer the strengths of nearly all major optical stellar absorption features in integrated galaxy light 
without ever detecting any of them.

This statement holds for any feature in any subsample except one. 
{\bfr State mean total offsets for both types (Table \ref{tbl:stats}).} It holds irrespective of the feature's 
width---{\bfr basic quantification}---and irrespective of the chemical species traced. 
It holds for strong features---e.g., the G band in passive objects {\bfr quote mean
EW}---and weak ones---e.g., Mg{\it b} in starforming ones {\bfr quote mean EW}. Simply: we 
knew the fluxes of each \AA ngstrom of our high resolution spectra before we got to the
telescope.

The lone exception is CA4227 in {\bfr passive}, but not starforming galaxies. {\bfr Something 
about the history of this line being anomalous, Ca-rich supernovae, etc.} As CSI was designed 
to probe spatial overdensities, {\bfr
and some of these objects are for real in dense places?}, we believe the $\sim$2.5\%
mismatch we see here may reflect the same phenomenon. Regardless, this finding suggests either that
slightly different abundance patterns should be assumed when fitting passive objects (\CITE), 
or that Ca4227 strengths might be used to enhance SFH estimates. We touch on the latter in 
Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but note here that any prior would have to be accurate to better than 
2\% in the mean for this relationship to be useful.

\subsection{The Balmer lines}
\label{sec:balmer}

Figure \ref{fig:balmer} shows the same offset summaries as Figure \ref{fig:resids} but for the three
strong Balmer lines in the prism data: H$\delta$, H$\gamma$, and H$\beta$. {\bfb LEA -- we'll have 
to see what these look like. I don't think there's anything interesting to be said here, just to show that
the only sizeable discrepancies are readily attributable to emission. If it holds up, we can also make
a note about the enhanced performance of the $H=1$ models here versus the chunky fits.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.9, trim = 1cm 0cm 0cm 0cm]{balmer}
\caption{\bfb Show the offsets for the Balmer line predictions; same styling as Figure \ref{fig:resids}.
		Can potentially add another panel for, e.g., H$\beta$ specifically showing the unmodelled 
		emission. Can also put this up in Figure \ref{fig:metric}, but I think best to bury it down here.}
\label{fig:balmer}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Systematic errors}
\label{sec:systematics}

The above comparisons are affected by {\bfr three} main systematics: redshift refinement, 
velocity broadening,
and continuum matching. {\bfb (LEA -- Dan, is the latter the case? Are the high-res IMACS data fluxed
to the same photometry as the prism data? Do we perform a 2nd order correction somewhere to take
out any continuum mismatches pre-comparison? If so, we'll state that above where noted and cut any
discussion from this section.)}

Regarding redshift refinement, both SFH inference techniques 
adopted discrete redshift steps of {\bfr $\Delta z = 0.01$} (Section \ref{sec:data}). 
This interval was sufficient
given the low resolution of the CSI data, but the newer IMACS data allow for
more precision. As such, there are typically mismatches of 
{\bfr $\delta z \approx ZZZ$} between the predicted locations of spectral features and where they 
ultimately appear in the high resolution data.

Regarding velocity broadening, the CSI data are likewise too coarse to permit velocity
dispersion estimates. As such, the high resolution spectral predictions
must be broadened from the native FSPS resolution to whatever the $R\sim800$ IMACS data imply
for each object. 

We correct for both issues by {\bfr Dan to discuss how he shifts and broadens the models here}.

These offsets are important: they illustrate the only first-order orthogonal axes in the problem of SFH 
reconstruction: velocity and age. They also show us that higher resolution spectra add meaningful 
signal in Doppler---if not age---space. Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that independent Doppler
information can be exploited to enhance SFH estimates (Section \ref{sec:discussion}). 
%{\bfb LEA -- the conclusion is that more pixels buy you velocity but not SFH stuff.

\subsection{Implications for direct SFH inference}
\label{sec:sedMap}

Our experiments imply that high resolution optical spectroscopy of any quality reasonable
to expect for individual distant objects will not meaningfully 
enhance knowledge of their underlying stellar populations compared to much more coarsely and broadly 
sampled datasets (see Section \ref{sec:stacking}). That is, absorption line 
details---at least as presented at a galaxy's velocity dispersion---are sufficiently correlated to 
stellar continua on large scales that capturing the details 
of the latter across a long enough wavelength baseline yields the same information as 
densely sampling the rest optical. There is therefore no need to obtain 
costly, high resolution spectroscopy for SFH inferences.\footnote{A future 
paper will show that, at $z\sim0.4$, the 26-band UltraVista filter set \citep{Muzzin13} performs 
similarly to CSI, meaning that even the prism data used here is likely oversampled.}
{\bfr In this, we reinforce findings by \citet{Pacifici12}, who show that---limited to 
rest optical data---$R\sim1000$ spectra enhance SFH estimates less than other inferences 
compared $R\sim100$ spectra (25\% v. 45\% drops in uncertainty; see their Table 2).} 
We would add, however, that, had that study incorporated UV--IR photometry, 
the gains would in fact be negligible.
Further insights into galaxy growth will not be gleaned by adding better spectra, but rather
from the methods and results that reveal why that statement is true.

The core lesson is not new. The fact that 
metallicity modulates continuum light on $\sim$100--1000\,\AA\ scales is apparent in the
output of any stellar population synthesis code. The phenomenon is also well recognized in 
some contexts, such as as the tracking of Balmer line depths with $U-B$ or D4000 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Kauffmann03}. What we have shown is simply that the above is true to--perhaps
to a greater than expected extent---for all (Lick) species. The observational trick is to sample the 
SED so as to capture all of the relevant signal at minimal cost. We do not know the optimal sampling,
 only that CSI apparently meets whatever criteria define it.

Nevertheless, these findings reinforce or suggest practical, informatic, and 
theoretical programs that we believe will be more informative than simply taking more or
better data.

\subsubsection{Practical}

The practical upshot of the above is twofold. First, there is no need to expend telescope
or computer time obtaining and modeling thousands of SED points for the purpose of inferring 
galaxy growth. Second, on the modeling side, the physical correlations between spectral
elements should be accounted for mathematically to avoid drawing inferences of unreasonable 
certainty. Each pixel may be formally independent, but it does not add a new degree of freedom.
{\bfb LEA -- this is the place to discuss previous work on or findings to this effect. The fact
that $S/N$ doesn't really matter has been noted in a bunch of places before, e.g., \citet{Leja19}.
We disagree with those authors about the utility of adding bedder spectra---even though they
see similar offsets to us (2\%; their Figure 8)---but may agree with \citet{Ocvirk06} about it?

The narrative here is something like: limited to the rest optical, Pacifici showed there's only
marginal gains from going to R=1000 spectra for SFH inferences vs R=100. Leja showed that, 
using UV--IR photometry, $S/N$ doesn't matter for SFH inferences. We do something like
combine the two: if you have sufficiently broad SED sampling, the SFHs you infer are good enough
to remove any reason for $S/N$ or resolution to matter because all of the information those
things could add has been accounted for.}

\subsubsection{Informatic}

The informatic upshot of the above is that there exists a data compression scheme---a way to
distill covariant pixels to independent degrees of freedom---that may be
worth identifying if SFH inferences for large samples is to play a substantial role in extragalactic 
astronomy's future. Given the deluge of SEDs that PFS, LSST, and WFIRST will soon deliver, 
modeling efficiency will be critical to characterising representative swaths of those datasets. 
It is likely that such a compression scheme will resemble what intuition
and, e.g., CSI suggests: sparse UV and IR sampling with finer---but not fine---sampling over
the rest optical, particularly from around the Balmer break to around the magnesium triplet,
where intermediate age stars make the greatest impression \citep[e.g.,][]{Dressler16}. However,
it is also possible it will not resemble that configuration, so we encourage serious work on this 
issue ({\bfr or cite and amplify}).

\subsubsection{Theoretical}

The theoretical upshot is that understanding this compression scheme---even if it is as basic 
as the above---represents understanding the extent to which information about the
physics an object was subject to over its history could possibly modulate its presentation at the one epoch we 
will ever witness it at. That is, it must reveal the bedrock of the SFH $\mapsto$ SED mapping, and 
therefore something close to the epistemological ceiling for the study of galaxy evolution. Knowledge 
of that boundary condition cannot but enhance the questions investigators ask and the investigations 
they pursue. Given the substantial human and technological resources devoted to such endeavors, 
that insight seems beneficial.

How mechanically to reverse engineer this compression scheme is a separate question. Machine learning 
could be used to identify via simulation the hypersurface characterising the precision to which 
$\Mstel(t)$ is knowable as a function of data---$S/N$, SED sampling---and galaxy 
properties---$z$, $\ssfr$, $Z$, $\sigma$, $A_{V}$, environment, morphology. A simpler exercise,
is simply to invert the experiment we performed, fitting SFHs only to high resolution optical 
spectra and predicting broadband fluxes the blue and red. One could then repeat this exercise 
downgrading the resolution or omitting portions of the starting spectrum and measuring how 
the extrapolations changed, adding outrigger photometry as soon as the predictions began to deviate
significantly from the truth. Figures 12 and D2 of \citet{Abramson20} show an examples of this kind of 
approach---and hint at the predictive quality as a function of SED type---which of 
course could also be coupled to machine learning.

%fits to
%low resolution rest-optical spectra like those from CSI do not predict, e.g., infrared
%broadband fluxes to the level the high resolution lines are reproduced here, but they
%do quite well in some systems. Of course, this exercise could also be coupled to machine learning.

Based on our results, however, similar exercises performed using only photometry 
(Abramson in preparation), and the physics at play, we suspect that full UV--IR 
wavelength coverage will be one of the foundations whatever map is finally produced: If all of 
the starlight is captured, the density of the sampling is secondary (provided it is sufficient
to obtain accurate redshifts). Future surveys designed to support SFH reconstruction should 
therefore opt for increased wavelength coverage at the expense of SED resolution. 
%It may remain easier to take multiplexed prism spectra 
%than a dozen bands worth of photometry, but it probably still represent oversampling.

%We suspect 
%that wavelength baseline is the underlying key to SED fitting. To test this, one could derive
%SFHs based on fits to the high resolution spectra presented here and try to predict the broadband
%fluxes well outside the rest optical. 

% The outcome of
%this test using high resolution spectra as a starting point would inform us as to the relative
%priority of broad baseline photometry vs deep spectroscopy in the study of galaxy growth. 
%{\bfr This is crap; you always need a redshift and I think ultimately that's the trick.}

%line information is determined by some (unknown) combination of the local and remote 
%continuum. 

%We already knew this: we knew that
%the continuum from [\ion{O}{ii}] to [\ion{O}{iii}] is linked 1:1 with the Balmer line strengths. 
%Of course, it's this way for all lines (it's all opacity), and BC03 tells you that, if you have enough
%precision on the continuum, you have the same purchase on the metallicity as you would if you 
%had all the lines. 

Of course, we are not asserting that there is never a reason to take high resolution spectra. If 
one is interested in understanding the IMF \citep{Conroy12}, or specific abundance 
patterns, it is necessary. We only argue that it seems unreasonable for these investigations to
qualitatively enhance assessments of galaxy growth. For example, it is clear that calcium strengths
add a relatively large amount of information to our predictions in passive galaxies. However,
while the prediction/data mismatches are perhaps 2$\times$ the average offset, they are still 
at the 2\% level. As such, to enhance SFH predictions, priors linking Ca abundance to age must 
be accurate to at least that level, and spectra must have $S/N\gtrsim14\,\AA^{-1}$. We 
believe attempting to construct such an object or take such data are endeavors of diminishing 
returns: aperture and other observational effects surely distort one's ability to interpret such 
precision when present, and---as in the case of calcium---other, more easily observed 
properties like environmental density (\CITE) are almost certainly equally good candidates 
for an age prior.

\subsubsection{What about stacking?}
\label{sec:stacking}

{\bfr Something about why it's not going to help to stack a bunch of objects to get $S/N\sim100$
in some average. *Maybe* a plot on the fact that you can only ever group things by where they 
appear, not where they start, which means you never really know what the output represents.}

%This fact prompts three questions: (1) Why? (2) What are the extra pixels doing? (3) What does
%this mean for the future? All of these relate to the difference between formal and meaningful 
%information content.

%The nature of this correlation is the mathematical key to understanding the SFH$\,\mapsto\,$SED 
%mapping, and therefore our ability to invert the latter to get at the former; i.e., execute an empirical 
%study of galaxy evolution.

\if0
In the immediate term, the upshot is that suitably sampled SEDs need never be well sampled, at least
not to understand mass growth (Section \ref{sec:redshifts}). What ``suitable'' means would be determined 
by the above investigation, but clearly CSI meets or exceeds that threshold at $z\lesssim1$.\footnote{A future 
paper will show that the 26-band UltraVista filter set \citep{Muzzin13} probably also does as well at 
$z\sim0.4$.} Of course, this implies that many current (and future; Section \ref{sec:future}) data sets 
are oversampled, and that it is inadvisable to use those for SFH modeling while assuming that each 
pixel adds one degree of freedom. Adding systematics that correlate pixels is a minimum requirement 
to reinflate the resultant SFH uncertainties, but a floor will ultimately be necessary. It is very possible 
that we have already reached that floor.

\subsection{Prospects for exploiting Doppler information}
\label{sec:redshifts}

One area where high resolution spectroscopy yields unique insight is velocity space. Since
galaxy kinematics can be inferred from line profiles, it's tempting to contemplate using these data
to place colour-independent total stellar mass priors on SED fits to data of any resolution. This
move is especially appealing as it would provide a handle on faint/old stars that might imprint on 
a galaxy's velocity dispersion but remain undetectable in its SED. 

Unfortunately, a number of complications suggest that doing so would not significantly improve
current methods.

The prior would most readily enter through a $\sigma$--$\Mstel$ relation. The intrinsic scatter
of this relation is $\sim$0.2 dex (\CITE), much broader than the formal---or even systematic---errors 
on SED-inferred stellar masses ({\bfr quote what we find; systematics as cross-method or duplicate
obs deifferences}). Further, that relation would be calibrated to stellar masses suffering the same 
systematic errors one wishes to correct by using the relation. Theoretically, a $\sigma$--S\'{e}rsic 
index--color relation could be used, but this entails its own issues regarding spatial resolution, 
aperture matching, and dust effects. Finally, due, e.g., to inside-out growth (\CITE) 
and the existence of thick disks, each stellar subpopulation may contribute its own velocity 
dispersion to the global profile. If so, modeling dispersions will re-introduce exactly that the same 
degeneracies in line decomposition as arose as in SED decomposing. These 
effects would have to be marginalized over the systematics from failing to do so would have to
be understood.

We are bearish on the ultimate utility of kinematic stellar mass constraints, 
but we also do not know of any SFH modeling that has attempted to incorporate it. A small 
study assessing its practicality and real-word effects would be edifying.

%
%We now discuss these points in turn.
%
%The explicit science motivator for this study was inferring SFH, and, to a lesser extent, galaxy 
%enrichment histories, which we have shown are consistent with flat to {\bfr XXX\%}. However, 
%these are not the only applications for high resolution spectroscopy, and it is in the Doppler
%domain where the extra pixels play a key role.
%
%Redshift assessment is the obvious example. We discussed the average redshift offset between
%our low resolution inferences and high resolution data in Section \ref{sec:systematics}. It is
%doubtful that SFH properties covary with redshift errors at that level in general, but it may in 
%some cases. At CSI's spectral resolution, for example, [\ion{O}{ii}] $\lambda 3727$ is 
%almost indistinguishable from the Balmer break. While the break has substantial leverage 
%on the SFH, [\ion{O}{ii}] has none. Aliasing the line as a break would inflate the number 
%of A stars above what is real and bias the SFH inference towards that age range. 
%
%We do not 
%find this to be a problem ({\bfr see Figures XXX?}), but were also able to perform accurate
%emission line modeling. That may not be the possible in ever more ubiquitous slitless 
%spectroscopy from HST and JWST, and so may be more a problem in the future.
%
%Velocity dispersion are the more interesting example. High resolution is clearly needed to
%accurately infer this information, and it is indirectly related to the SFH through a galaxy's
%total stellar mass. Indeed, in principle, absent lensing, velocity dispersions are the only
%colour-independent mass estimators available. They are thus potentially powerful constraints
%even when their uncertainties are large.
%

%We are unaware of any SFH modeling that has incorporated or applied such a prior, but
%it should be explored. Unfortunately, at {\bfr 0.2 dex?}, the relation is probably not tight 
%enough to be decisive, but, if colour or structural subclasses are considered---it may help. 

%Principle among these in terms of SFH reconstruction is the determination of redshift. At high 
%resolution, the available number
%of constraining features is much higher than in the CSI data. {\bfr Something about the average
%redshift offset we find, the need to allow that to re-float when moving the predictions, whether
%that level of jiggle was appropriately marginalzied over in the original SFH inference, and whether
%that mattered.} This means that redshift--SFH covariance is stronger than it needs to be, inflating 
%the uncertainties on the latter. Furthermore, the added uncertainty comes in key places: 

%{\bfr A paragraph on the trivial cases of emission lines and IMF?}

\if 0
The trivial instance of this is in measuring emission lines, where resolution is needed to 
identify, e.g., embedded Balmer lines and detect subtle features like [\ion{O}{iii}] 
$\lambda4363$ ({\bfr cite Sanders}). Especially at low $S/N$, each pixel definitely counts
for these applications, and estimates of, e.g., nebular extinction, ISM metallicity, or outflow
properties will improve with every additional datum.

A yet more pertinent use would be to constrain the IMF \citep{Conroy12}. While doing so 
would have no bearing on the relative accuracies of SFH inferences, it would allow all stellar 
masses to be placed on a firmer absolute scale, which should enhance these objects power to test 
simulations or first-principles theoretical predictions. %Of course, if the IMF is allowed to vary with 
%time, one encounters the same problems as with $\sigma$.
