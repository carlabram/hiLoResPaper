\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is to understand stellar mass growth; i.e., 
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are the key empirical anchor 
in this work because they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar populations of 
known ages. The resulting coefficients encode the stellar mass a galaxy formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each population's age.
	
Different stellar populations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. Galaxy SED decompositions 
are therefore degenerate. The degeneracies are compounded by formally age-independent effects 
like metallicity and dust. 

In theory, using higher resolution spectra should ameliorate this issue: the absorption lines visible 
in such data increase the contrast between stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicities, and so yield 
better age/mass coefficients. In practice, this is not the case.

We perform a simple experiment to assess the added utility of $R\sim800$ spectra in 
reconstructing SFHs as compared to $R\sim25$ prism data and broadband photometry. We:
\benum
	\item infer SFHs from low-resolution data;
	\item create high-resolution model spectra from those inferences;
	\item compare the predictions to high-resolution data obtained post facto for the same
		objects. 
\eenum

In a sample of \ntot\ galaxies at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$, in the median, 
we predict all but one Lick absorption feature \citep{Worthey94} to better than 1\%---including 
{\bfr those outside the original spectral bandpass}. The exception---Ca4227 in passive 
galaxies only---is known to behave anomalously, and is only $\sim$2.5\% weaker than expected. 

%Thus, absent a prior linking Ca to age accurate to better than 2.5\%, 
We conclude that the additional pixels in high-resolution spectra do not add independent 
colour-related SFH constraints. Such data are therefore unnecessary for SED decompositions.
However, if model-dependencies do not pose undue challenges, they may remain useful
in providing kinematic total stellar mass constraints.

Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data for our experiment, \ref{sec:results} compares 
the spectral predictions to the high-resolution data, and \ref{sec:discussion} discusses 
the implications of these results. We use AB magnitudes and assume 
a \citet{Chabrier03} stellar initial mass function (IMF) with $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) =
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$ throughout.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Master sample}
\label{sec:master}

We use data from the {\it Carnegie Spitzer IMACS Survey} \citep[CSI;][]{Kelson14a}. CSI provides
Magellan-IMACS Low- and Uniform-Dispersion Prism spectroscopy (\CITE) for objects with {\it Spitzer} 
$[3.5]\leq21$ in {\bfr XXX sq.~deg.} from {\bfr THESE FIELDS}. Combined with supplemental 
$ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry from the NEWFIRM archive (\CITE) and Canada-France-Hawai`i Telescope 
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; \CITE), these data were used to derive flexible SFHs for each galaxy
during redshift estimation. The sample is complete to $\logM\sim10.3$ at $z\sim0.7$.
The spectral resolution of the prisms varies from $R\sim{\bfr XXX}$ to $R\sim{\bfr YYY}$ at
{\bfr wavelengths}, about {\bfr THIS MUCH WORSE} than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York00}.

We derive SFHs from these data in two ways. Our results are quantitatively similar
using either approach.

%{\it None of these details are important in the context of the experiment we 
%detail below}, which should be repeated using other approaches.

\subsubsection{Technique 1 for inferring SFHs from low-resolution SEDs}
\label{sec:blocks}

The CSI spectrophotometry was first modeled using 5 precomputed SEDs based on SFHs with 
constant star formation rates from:
\bitem
	\item 0.0 to 0.2 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.2 to 0.5 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.5 to 1.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 1.0 to 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$ to $z=5$;
\eitem
where $\tobs$ corresponds to the object's redshift and $z=5$ is taken as the onset of star formation. If 
the data prefer, the oldest bin could also take the form of a 1 Gyr top hat starting at $z=5$. 
\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} examine these SFHs in detail with the latter containing a thorough 
treatment of their quality in its Appendix.

Each of the above SED bases was allowed to take an independent $A_{V}$ (\citealt{Calzetti00} 
extinction) but not metallicity. Global metallicities were inferred using a prior peaked at 
$Z=Z_{\odot}$. As such, the predicted spectra do not capture enrichment histories 
\citep[cf.][]{Pacifici12, Morishita19}. The predictive accuracy of these models stands despite this fact (Section \ref{sec:results}).

The spectral templates were generated using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis 
\citep[FSPS;][]{ConroyGunnWhite09} assuming default abundance patterns. When inferring the SFHs, 
these models---5 mass amplitudes + 5 $A_{V}$s + 1 metallicity + 1 redshift + {\bfr 1} spectrophotometry fluxing 
factor + {\bfr N} emission line amplitudes = {\bfr XXX} free parameters---were typically constrained by 
7 + {\bfr $\sim$100} photometric + spectral datapoints.

Hereafter, we refer to this approach as ``Technique 1.''

\subsubsection{Technique 2 for inferring SFHs from low-resolution SEDs}
\label{sec:h1}

Subsequent to \citet{Dressler18}, all CSI spectrophotometry was refit using a new 
SFH inference scheme based on a library of {\bfr XXX} $H=1$ stochastic tracks
(\citealt{Kelson14,Kelson16,Kelson19}, Abramson in preparation). The tracks comprise {\bfr YYY} 
independent increments and are agnostic to the age of the universe: the same track can be stretched 
to span an arbitrary $t\in[t_{0},\,\tobs]$ interval, with the absolute size of each increment in years 
changing with a galaxy's redshift. The typical star formation increment at the sample's mean redshift 
is {\bfr XXX Myr} with model spectrophotometry generated at {\bfr $\Delta z = 0.01$} increments for
redshift estimation.

These models assume monolithic values for both metallicity and extinction. Following 
\citealt{Pacifici12}, the fitter finds for each $H=1$ track in the library that probability that it generated
an observed SED given a redshift, metallicity, $A_{V}$, spectral fluxing function ({\bfr FORM}), and 
set of emission line amplitudes. All SED templates were generated using FSPS with default abundances.

Hereafter, we refer to this approach as ``Technique 2.''

\subsection{High-resolution spectroscopy}
\label{sec: hiRes}

\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} identified a class of galaxies inferred to have formed at least half of 
their stars within 1--2 Gyr of the epoch of observation---``late bloomers.'' The extreme nature of such objects
prompted us to obtain higher resolution spectroscopy to crosscheck and further interpret those results. 
%were obtained for a subset of both late blooming and non late blooming galaxies
%at $z\sim0.7$, or $\tobs\sim7$ Gyr.

{\bfr High resolution---$R\sim800$---rest-optical spectra were obtained with Magellan-IMACS in DATES. 
Dan will tell you all about it, including how many objects, and a brief description of $S/N$/data quality/etc.}

Figure \ref{fig:sample} shows the distributions in {\bfr stellar mass, {\it UVJ} colour-colour space, 
and inferred half-mass time} of the sample objects.

\section{Confronting predictions with high-resolution data}
\label{sec:results}

Here we compare the model spectra generated using either the maximum-likelihood set of SFH 
parameters from Technique 1 (Section \ref{sec:blocks}) or $H=1$ track and corresponding 
parameters from Technique 2 (\ref{sec:h1}). Uncertainties are tabulated for the SFHs and parameters 
in both techniques, but not propagated to the corresponding high-resolution spectral predictions. 
Combined with the fact that both SFH reconstruction techniques assume an age-independent 
metallicity, the experiment below is biased {\it towards} revealing significant differences between 
the high-resolution spectra and the model predictions: the latter are less flexible than they could 
be and given greater credence than they should be.

{\bfr LEA -- some note here about whether we're going to focus on the full spectrum or just the ``line
strengths.'' The latter is justified because it's the real value-add of the high-res data, and also because
I assume the same photometry was used to flux both the prism data and the high-res spectra. We
just have to explain it.}

\subsection{Experimental setup}

Figure \ref{fig:scheme} {\bfr (3 panels?)} outlines the experiment. The {\bfr top} panels show the
CSI spectrophotometry for a galaxy at redshift {\bfr ZZZ}, along with its inferred SFH using Technique 
1 (left) and 2 (right). The CSI data have broad wavelength 
coverage and dense but low-resolution sampling over the rest optical. As such, they reflect a relatively
complete accounting of a galaxy's stellar photospheric continuum emission. That said, 
the strongest/broadest absorption features---such as the Mg triplet at 5170\,\AA---are sometimes
identifiable.

Figure \ref{fig:scheme}, {\bfr bottom}, shows the complete high-resolution IMACS spectrum of 
this object with the matched-resolution spectral predictions from the SFHs in the top panels overlaid. 
Results from Technique 1 and 2 are in {\bfr color 1} and {\bfr color 2}, \resp. 

The data in the two top panels are identical; only the models change from left to right. Likewise,
both model predictions are compared to the same $R\sim800$ IMACS data. We therefore perform two 
experiments in parallel, identical except for the method from which the high-resolution prediction is 
generated. {\bfr When appropriate, we comment on the differences between the results from each
technique (Sections A, B, C), but these are ancillary to our main point.}

Figure \ref{fig:metric} illustrates how we compare our spectral predictions to the high-resolution data.
Here, we re-present Figure \ref{fig:scheme}, bottom, zoomed-in to the region surrounding {\bfr FEATURE}.
{\bfr If we need to divide one by the other, we'll make this 2 panels.} The central bandpass of the corresponding
Lick index is shown in {\bfr however} (\CITE). We define the mismatch between prediction and high-resolution
data as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta = {\rm whatever~Dan~says}.
\end{equation}
That is, a quoted difference of 5\% in a given spectral feature corresponds to {\bfr whatever per-angstrom
offset integrated over however many angstroms, or whatever Dan did.}

We then compute {\bfr$\Delta$} for each Lick bandpass in each galaxy.

	\label{fig:scheme}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{residuals}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:metric}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sample-wide outcome}

Figure \ref{fig:resids} summarizes the quality of our model predictions across the entire sample of
\ntot\ objects. The top panel shows results based on Technique 1, the bottom Technique 2. The centerline
of each box shows the median offset across the sample for each feature with the upper and lower boundaries
showing the 16th and 84th percentiles. Results based on the full sample are in black, with red and blue 
boxes denoting {\bfr SFR- or age-defined} subsamples. The width of each box corresponds to the width 
of each feature's bandpass. Regimes outside the original prism wavelength range are highlighted 
{\bfr in some color}, and the dashed and dotted horizontal lines \resp\ denote mismatches at the 
1\% and 2\% level.

From Figure \ref{fig:resids}, it is clear that {\it almost all rest-optical absorption features in galaxy 
spectra visible in high-resolution data are predicted to better than 1\% by models that make no reference
to such data.} That is, to a very high degree of accuracy, one can infer the strengths of all optical
stellar absorption features without ever actually detecting any of them.

This statement holds to better than 1.5\% across the entire sample, and indeed better than 1\% for any 
feature in any subsample except one. {\bfr State mean total offsets for both types.} It holds irrespective 
of the feature's width---{\bfr basic quantification}---and irrespective of the chemical species from which 
the feature derives. It holds for strong features---e.g., the G band in passive objects {\bfr quote mean
EW}---and weak ones---e.g., Mg{\it b} in starforming ones {\bfr quote mean EW}. Quite simply: we 
knew what the fluxes of each \AA\ in the high-resolution spectra would be well before we took the data.

The lone exception to the above is CA4227 in {\bfr passive}, but not starforming galaxies. {\bfr Something 
about the history of this line being anomalous.} We believe the relatively large extent of the mismatch we 
see here may reflect this phenomenon, which in turn suggests one of two things: either slightly different
abundance patterns should be assumed when fitting passive objects, or a Ca4227 holds the potential
to enhance SFH estimates. We touch on the latter in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but note here that
any prior would have to be accurate to better than 2\% in the mean for this relationship to be useful.

	\item Show an example of how the residuals are calculated. (Center of bandpass? Integrated EW
		difference? Mean offset across bandpass?)
	\item Show the summary residuals across the sameple. Show the breakdown by UVJ and age 
		(half mass time). 	Do this only for the absorption lines. Overlay H=1 and blocky results? Possibly use
		only one approach and discuss any offsets. If so, show all of the spectra? We'll want a comparison 
		plot (residuals v. residuals) for internal use. In the final plot, highlight any features that are 
		outside the 	prism bandpass.

Spectral features observable in costly, high-resolution spectroscopy are readily predicted by 
models fit to cheaper broadband photometry and prism spectra. As such, obtaining the former 
seems irrelevant for investigators interested in inferring galaxy SFHs.

This fact prompts three questions: (1) Why? (2) What are the extra pixels doing? (3) What does
this mean for the future? All of these relate to the difference between formal and meaningful 
information content.

\subsection{Spectral pixels are correlated}
\label{sec:pixels}

Driving the outcomes we find is the reality that most of the pixels in high resolution 
spectra are not physically independent, even if they are mathematically so. This is obvious to 
some extent---Balmer line depths track $B-V$ or D4000---but we find that practically all of the 
line information is determined by some (unknown) combination of the local and remote 
continuum. These physical correlations should be mathematically accounted for in the SED 
modeling to avoid making statements of unreasonable certainty.

The nature of this correlation is the mathematical key to understanding the SFH$\,\mapsto\,$SED 
mapping, and therefore our ability to invert the latter to get at the former; i.e., execute an empirical 
study of galaxy evolution. Machine learning may be the way to illuminate this mapping, whose concrete 
output would be a hypersurface characterizing the precision to which $\Mstel(t)$ is informatically 
accessible as a function of data---$S/N$, SED sampling---and galaxy properties---$z$, $\ssfr$, $Z$, 
$\sigma$, $A_{V}$, environment, morphology. 

A first step in the above endeavor is to invert the experiment we performed here. We suspect 
that wavelength baseline is the underlying key to SED fitting. To test this, one could derive
SFHs based on fits to the high resolution spectra presented here and try to predict the broadband
fluxes well outside the rest optical. Examining Figure 12 of \citet{Abramson20}, fits to
low resolution rest-optical spectra like those from CSI used here do not predict, e.g., infrared
broadband fluxes to the level the high resolution lines are reproduced here. The outcome of
this test using high resolution spectra as a starting point would inform us as to the relative
priority of broad baseline photometry vs deep spectroscopy in the study of galaxy growth. 
{\bfr This is crap; you always need a redshift and I think ultimately that's the trick.}

In the immediate term, the upshot is that suitably sampled SEDs need never be well sampled, at least
not to understand mass growth (Section \ref{sec:redshifts}). What ``suitable'' means would be determined 
by the above investigation, but clearly CSI meets or exceeds that threshold at $z\lesssim1$.\footnote{A future 
paper will show that the 26-band UltraVista filter set \citep{Muzzin13} probably also does as well at 
$z\sim0.4$.} Of course, this implies that many current (and future; Section \ref{sec:future}) data sets 
are oversampled, and that it is inadvisable to use those for SFH modeling while assuming that each 
pixel adds one degree of freedom. Adding systematics that correlate pixels is a minimum requirement 
to reinflate the resultant SFH uncertainties, but a floor will ultimately be necessary. It is very possible 
that we have already reached that floor.
% in terms of the number/span of bandpasses required to 
%predict SFHs to a given precision as a function of redshift 
%though it is very different from the question of ``What is a galaxy's SFH?'' 

\subsection{Where is the information going?}
\label{sec:redshifts}

The explicit science motivator for this study was inferring SFH, and, to a lesser extent, galaxy 
enrichment histories, which we have shown are consistent with flat to {\bfr XXX\%}. However, 
these are not the only applications for high resolution spectroscopy, and it is in other domains 
where the extra pixels indeed play a role.

Principle among these in terms of SFH reconstruction is the determination of redshift. At high 
resolution, the available number
of constraining features is much higher than in the CSI data. {\bfr Something about the average
redshift offset we find, the need to allow that to re-float when moving the predictions, whether
that level of jiggle was appropriately marginalzied over in the original SFH inference, and whether
that mattered.} This means that redshift--SFH covariance is stronger than it needs to be, inflating 
the uncertainties on the latter. Furthermore, the added uncertainty comes in key places: At CSI's 
spectral resolution, [\ion{O}{ii}] $\lambda 3727$ is almost indistinguishable from the Balmer break. 
While the break has substantial leverage on the SFH, [\ion{O}{ii}] has none. A failure to resolve these 
may bias the SFH by implying a larger amount of A stars than is real. While we do not find this to 
be a critical problem ({\bfr see Figures XXX}), it does rely on accurate emission line modeling, 
which may be difficult in the case of ever more ubiquitous slitless spectroscopy (from HST, JWST). 

Secondary in the context of SFH reconstruction is in assessing stellar velocity dispersions. Each 
additional sampling of a line profile increases the certainty on that parameter (at fixed $S/N$). 
This certainty is useful because velocity dispersions are color-independent mass proxies and are 
thus {\it truly} orthogonal to stellar subpopulation SEDs into which one is decomposing a galaxy SED.
Velocity dispersions might thus provide strict mass limits capable of breaking some of the degeneracies 
mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro}: If there existed a suitably tight relation between $\sigma$
and $\Mstel$, one could apply it as a prior in the SED fitting to constrain the amount of faint old 
stars that would imprint on the dispersion but perhaps not be detectable in the SED.

Unfortunately, at {\bfr 0.2 dex?}, that relation is probably not tight enough to be decisive. Further,
allowances should be made that---due, e.g., to inside-out growth (\CITE), the existence of thick disks, 
etc.---each stellar subpopulation has a different velocity dispersion, such the same degeneracies in
decomposing the global $\sigma$ constraint into pieces arise as did with the SED. Both of these 
effects would have to be marginalized over. While we do not know precisely how these effects 
would modulate the utility of $\sigma$ as an SFH constraint, we would predict them to 
substantially erode it.

{\bfr A paragraph on the trivial cases of emission lines and IMF?}

\if 0
The trivial instance of this is in measuring emission lines, where resolution is needed to 
identify, e.g., embedded Balmer lines and detect subtle features like [\ion{O}{iii}] 
$\lambda4363$ ({\bfr cite Sanders}). Especially at low $S/N$, each pixel definitely counts
for these applications, and estimates of, e.g., nebular extinction, ISM metallicity, or outflow
properties will improve with every additional datum.

A yet more pertinent use would be to constrain the IMF \citep{Conroy12}. While doing so 
would have no bearing on the relative accuracies of SFH inferences, it would allow all stellar 
masses to be placed on a firmer absolute scale, which should enhance these objects power to test 
simulations or first-principles theoretical predictions. %Of course, if the IMF is allowed to vary with 
%time, one encounters the same problems as with $\sigma$.
%Redshifts, velocity dispersions, emission line details.
