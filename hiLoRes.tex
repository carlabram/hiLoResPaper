\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is to understand stellar mass growth; i.e., 
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are key data in this work because 
they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar populations of known ages. The resulting 
coefficients yield the stellar mass a galaxy can be said to have formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each subpopulation's age.
	
Different stellar populations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. As such, galaxy decompositions 
are degenerate. Those degeneracies are compounded by age-independent effects like metallicity 
and dust. 

High resolution spectra ($R\sim500$--5000) might alleviate those degeneracies 
in SFH modeling---the absorption features visible in those data might increase the contrast 
between stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicities, and yield more accurate 
age/mass coefficients. However, we find that this is not the case.

In a simple experiment, we find that there is almost no color-related information in high resolution 
spectra that enhance constraints on galaxy SFH inferences compared to using much lower
resolution ($R\sim25$) prism spectra and broadband photometry.\footnote{A future paper will 
extend this statement to pure photometry-based inferences.} The experiment is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Derive SFHs from low-resolution SEDs;
	\item Predict their high-resolution SEDs and compare to high-resolution data obtained 
		post-facto ($R\sim800$).
\end{itemize}

Based on \ntot\ systems at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$, we find high resolution data to differ from 
low resolution model predictions at {\it less than 1\% for all but one} absorption feature in the 
Lick index system \citep{Worthey94}. {\bfr This includes features outside the bandpass of the 
low resolution prism data}. The lone exception is a Ca feature in {\it UVJ}-selected passive 
galaxies \citep{Williams09} that is well known to be anomalous, where the line is $\sim2.5\%$ 
weaker than expected. Absent a prior linking Ca to age accurate to that level, we conclude that there
is no utility in using high resolution spectra for SFH inferences from a stellar population perspective. 
Some utility may still be found in dynamical mass constraints such data provide, but that remains to be
demonstrated.

Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data for our experiment, Section \ref{sec:results} compares 
our spectral predictions and the high resolution data, and Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses 
the implications of these results. We use AB magnitudes and assume 
a \citet{Chabrier03} stellar initial mass function (IMF) with $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) =
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$ throughout.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Master sample}
\label{sec:master}

This experiment is based on the {\it Carnegie Spitzer IMACS Survey} \citep[CSI;][]{Kelson14a}. CSI provides
Magellan-IMACS Low- and Uniform-Dispersion Prism spectroscopy (\CITE) for objects with {\it Spitzer} 
$[3.5]\leq21$ in {\bfr XXX sq.~deg.} from {\bfr THESE FIELDS}. Combined with supplemental 
$ugrizJK_{s}$ photometry from the NEWFIRM archive (\CITE) and Canada-France-Hawai`i Telescope 
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS; \CITE), these data were used to derive flexible SFHs for each galaxy as part of 
the redshift estimation process. The sample is complete to $\logM\sim10.3$ at $z\sim0.7$.
The spectral resolution of the prisms varies from $R\sim{\bfr XXX}$ to $R\sim{\bfr YYY}$ at
{\bfr wavelengths}, about {\bfr THIS MUCH WORSE} than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{York00}.

\citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} examine the CSI SFHs in detail. \citet{Dressler18} provides a thorough treatment 
of CSI SFH quality in its Appendix. We defer the reader to those texts for that information, but briefly review 
the SFH inference process here. {\it None of these details are important in the context of the experiment we 
detail below}, which should be repeated using other approaches.

The CSI spectrophotometry was using 5 precomputed SEDs based on SFHs with constant star formation 
rates (SFRs) spanning:
\bitem
	\item 0.0 to 0.2 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.2 to 0.5 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 0.5 to 1.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 1.0 to 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$;
	\item 2.0 Gyr prior to $\tobs$ to $z=5$;
\eitem
where $\tobs$ corresponds to the object's redshift and $z=5$ is taken as the onset of star formation. If 
the data prefer, the oldest bin can also take the form of a 1 Gyr top hat starting at $z=5$.
The median redshift of the samples studied in \citet{Dressler16, Dressler18} is $z\sim0.7$, or $\tobs\sim7$ Gyr.

Each of the above SEDs was allowed to take an independent $A_{V}$ (assuming a \citealt{Calzetti00} 
extinction law) but not metallicity. The latter was inferred using a prior peaked at $Z=Z_{\odot}$. As such,
the predicted spectra do not capture the likely enrichment history of any object 
\citep[cf.][]{Pacifici12, Morishita19}---a fact to bear in mind as we proceed.

All spectral templates were generated using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis 
\citep[FSPS;][]{ConroyGunnWhite09} assuming default abundance patterns. When inferring the SFHs, 
these models---5 mass amplitudes + 5 $A_{V}$s + 1 metallicity + 1 redshift + {\bfr 1} spectrophotometry fluxing 
factor + {\bfr N} emission line amplitudes = {\bfr XXX} free parameters---were typically constrained by 
7 + {\bfr $\sim$100} photometric + spectral datapoints. The spectral models studied below are were 
regenerated using the best-fit SFH parameters at $R\sim800$ in the rest optical. Uncertainties are tabulated
for the SFH bins but {\it not} propagated to the high resolution model spectra. As they therefore rely purely on 
data uncertainties, all comparisons below should be regarded as conservative.

\section{Implications}
\label{sec:discussion}

Spectral features observable in costly, high-resolution spectroscopy are readily predicted by 
models fit to cheaper broadband photometry and prism spectra. As such, obtaining the former 
seems irrelevant for investigators interested in inferring galaxy SFHs.

This fact prompts three questions: (1) Why? (2) What are the extra pixels doing? (3) What does
this mean for the future? All of these relate to the difference between formal and meaningful 
information content.

\subsection{Spectral pixels are correlated}
\label{sec:pixels}

Driving the outcomes we find is the reality that most of the pixels in high resolution 
spectra are not physically independent, even if they are mathematically so. This is obvious to 
some extent---Balmer line depths track $B-V$ or D4000---but we find that practically all of the 
line information is determined by some (unknown) combination of the local and remote 
continuum. These physical correlations should be mathematically accounted for in the SED 
modeling to avoid making statements of unreasonable certainty.

The nature of this correlation is the mathematical key to understanding the SFH$\,\mapsto\,$SED 
mapping, and therefore our ability to invert the latter to get at the former; i.e., execute an empirical 
study of galaxy evolution. Machine learning may be the way to illuminate this mapping, whose concrete 
output would be a hypersurface characterizing the precision to which $\Mstel(t)$ is informatically 
accessible as a function of data---$S/N$, SED sampling---and galaxy properties---$z$, $\ssfr$, $Z$, 
$\sigma$, $A_{V}$, environment, morphology. 

A first step in the above endeavor is to invert the experiment we performed here. We suspect 
that wavelength baseline is the underlying key to SED fitting. To test this, one could derive
SFHs based on fits to the high resolution spectra presented here and try to predict the broadband
fluxes well outside the rest optical. Examining Figure 12 of \citet{Abramson20}, fits to
low resolution rest-optical spectra like those from CSI used here do not predict, e.g., infrared
broadband fluxes to the level the high resolution lines are reproduced here. The outcome of
this test using high resolution spectra as a starting point would inform us as to the relative
priority of broad baseline photometry vs deep spectroscopy in the study of galaxy growth. 
{\bfr This is crap; you always need a redshift and I think ultimately that's the trick.}

In the immediate term, the upshot is that suitably sampled SEDs need never be well sampled, at least
not to understand mass growth (Section \ref{sec:redshifts}). What ``suitable'' means would be determined 
by the above investigation, but clearly CSI meets or exceeds that threshold at $z\lesssim1$.\footnote{A future 
paper will show that the 26-band UltraVista filter set \citep{Muzzin13} probably also does as well at 
$z\sim0.4$.} Of course, this implies that many current (and future; Section \ref{sec:future}) data sets 
are oversampled, and that it is inadvisable to use those for SFH modeling while assuming that each 
pixel adds one degree of freedom. Adding systematics that correlate pixels is a minimum requirement 
to reinflate the resultant SFH uncertainties, but a floor will ultimately be necessary. It is very possible 
that we have already reached that floor.
% in terms of the number/span of bandpasses required to 
%predict SFHs to a given precision as a function of redshift 
%though it is very different from the question of ``What is a galaxy's SFH?'' 

\subsection{Where is the information going?}
\label{sec:redshifts}

The explicit science motivator for this study was inferring SFH, and, to a lesser extent, galaxy 
enrichment histories, which we have shown are consistent with flat to {\bfr XXX\%}. However, 
these are not the only applications for high resolution spectroscopy, and it is in other domains 
where the extra pixels indeed play a role.

Principle among these in terms of SFH reconstruction is the determination of redshift. At high 
resolution, the available number
of constraining features is much higher than in the CSI data. {\bfr Something about the average
redshift offset we find, the need to allow that to re-float when moving the predictions, whether
that level of jiggle was appropriately marginalzied over in the original SFH inference, and whether
that mattered.} This means that redshift--SFH covariance is stronger than it needs to be, inflating 
the uncertainties on the latter. Furthermore, the added uncertainty comes in key places: At CSI's 
spectral resolution, [\ion{O}{ii}] $\lambda 3727$ is almost indistinguishable from the Balmer break. 
While the break has substantial leverage on the SFH, [\ion{O}{ii}] has none. A failure to resolve these 
may bias the SFH by implying a larger amount of A stars than is real. While we do not find this to 
be a critical problem ({\bfr see Figures XXX}), it does rely on accurate emission line modeling, 
which may be difficult in the case of ever more ubiquitous slitless spectroscopy (from HST, JWST). 

Secondary in the context of SFH reconstruction is in assessing stellar velocity dispersions. Each 
additional sampling of a line profile increases the certainty on that parameter (at fixed $S/N$). 
This certainty is useful because velocity dispersions are color-independent mass proxies and are 
thus {\it truly} orthogonal to stellar subpopulation SEDs into which one is decomposing a galaxy SED.
Velocity dispersions might thus provide strict mass limits capable of breaking some of the degeneracies 
mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro}: If there existed a suitably tight relation between $\sigma$
and $\Mstel$, one could apply it as a prior in the SED fitting to constrain the amount of faint old 
stars that would imprint on the dispersion but perhaps not be detectable in the SED.

Unfortunately, at {\bfr 0.2 dex?}, that relation is probably not tight enough to be decisive. Further,
allowances should be made that---due, e.g., to inside-out growth (\CITE), the existence of thick disks, 
etc.---each stellar subpopulation has a different velocity dispersion, such the same degeneracies in
decomposing the global $\sigma$ constraint into pieces arise as did with the SED. Both of these 
effects would have to be marginalized over. While we do not know precisely how these effects 
would modulate the utility of $\sigma$ as an SFH constraint, we would predict them to 
substantially erode it.

{\bfr A paragraph on the trivial cases of emission lines and IMF?}

\if 0
The trivial instance of this is in measuring emission lines, where resolution is needed to 
identify, e.g., embedded Balmer lines and detect subtle features like [\ion{O}{iii}] 
$\lambda4363$ ({\bfr cite Sanders}). Especially at low $S/N$, each pixel definitely counts
for these applications, and estimates of, e.g., nebular extinction, ISM metallicity, or outflow
properties will improve with every additional datum.

A yet more pertinent use would be to constrain the IMF \citep{Conroy12}. While doing so 
would have no bearing on the relative accuracies of SFH inferences, it would allow all stellar 
masses to be placed on a firmer absolute scale, which should enhance these objects power to test 
simulations or first-principles theoretical predictions. %Of course, if the IMF is allowed to vary with 
%time, one encounters the same problems as with $\sigma$.
