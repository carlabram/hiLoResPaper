%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

A central ambition of the study of galaxy evolution is understanding stellar mass growth; i.e., galaxy
star formation histories (SFHs). Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are the key data in this work because 
they can be decomposed into combinations of distinct stellar populations of known ages. The resulting 
coefficients yield the amount of stellar mass a galaxy is inferred to have formed at the lookback time 
corresponding to each population's age.

Stellar populations have different but not orthogonal SEDs. As such, the above decompositions are 
usually degenerate. Such degeneracies are compounded by age-independent effects like metallicity and 
dust reddening. 

To alleviate those degeneracies, high resolution spectra ($R\sim1000$s) are often used in addition to 
galaxy broadband colors in the model fitting. The hope is that the details of absorption lines will potentially 
increase the contrast between stellar subpopulations, constrain metallicity, and so yield more accurate 
age/mass coefficients. The utility of these data is usually taken as axiomatic, but it is also readily testable. 

This paper presents an experiment that shows there is very little information in high resolution spectra
that enhance constraints on galaxy SFHs compared to inferences based on a combination of photometry and 
very low resolution ($R\lesssim100$s) prism spectra.\footnote{A future paper will extend this statement 
to photometry based inferences alone.} We perform this experiment by using precomputed SFH inferences
based on low resolution SEDs for a set of \ntot\ systems at $\langle z\rangle=\midz$ to produce predictions 
of each galaxy's high-resolution spectrum, and comparing these predictions to actual high resolution 
observations taken post-facto. With the exception of the Balmer lines---whose divergence from predictions 
is readily ascribable to emission line infilling---we find differences to be of order {\bfr whatever they are}, 
suggesting {\bfr whatever we say they do}.

Throughout, we use AB magnitudes and assume $(H_{0}, \Omega_{M}, \Omega_{\Lambda}) = 
(70~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}, 0.3, 0.7)$.
